CUP Score
=========

*Cumulative Unpainted Pixel Score* is a heuristic for interface snappiness.

Given a video of a loading experience (obtainable from [webpagetest](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/)), cupscore returns a 'snappiness' score.

Usage:
```sh
cup-compare screenshot1 screenshot2 | cup-magnitude
```
